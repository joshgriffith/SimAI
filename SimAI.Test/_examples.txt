Count the files in c:/code

When you see a red square on my screen, send me an email with a screenshot of it.  (ambiguous:  screenshot)

How many capitalized words are in c:/foo.txt?  (ambiguous:  read file versus read 'c:/foo.txt' literal)

Count how many times I click my mouse over the next 10 seconds

Make me a list of all the telecommute jobs on Craigslist.  Make sure you do not access more than one page every 5 seconds

Send me an email of a cat (somewhat ambiguous)

Where are most of my songs stored?
