Intent splitter / dispatcher:

Wash the dishes, then go to the store:  (wash the dishes) (go to the store)

memory tokenizer:  Skill to tokenize prompt for storage / long-term memory

dispatcher skill chain:

  dispatch(wash(dishes), go(store))
  dispatch(wash the dishes, go to the store)



  Transform prompt all at once:
  wash(dishes).go(store)

  Transform skips (Azure LUIS way):
  1. Dispatcher 'skill' splits into two intents
  2. Each intent is computed separately and then combined
  3. Dispatcher orchestrates
